                Dorm Simulator is a fully interactive game I developed independently using Unity and C# scripting in Visual Studio. 
                The game places players in a worn-out college apartment, allowing them to explore their surroundings in first person. 
                As they progress, they'll encounter interactable objects to guide them through the setting. They'll even have to converse with a zombie NPC, convincing it to help them out. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Unity and C#</b>
                <br>
                In Unity, I created a C# script to control the interactivity and flow of a scene using a single controller. 
                This script managed a sequence of dialogue-triggering objects, subsequent animations, and audio cues, in order to guide the player through the narrative. 
                <br>For example, triggering an object's collider would would activate a dialogue box. 
                Then, by pressing the interaction button, it will activate the animation controller, cuing an accompanying audio and unlocking the next interactive element. 
                This approach allowed me to maintain clean, modular code while creating a more immersive, story-driven gameplay experience.

              <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                <b>OpenAI's Chatbot API & NPC Dialogue</b>
                <br>
                I integrated OpenAI's API into my Unity project through the Package Manager to enable real-time AI-generated dialogue with a non-playable zombie character. 
                After players explore the dorm environment, they can approach the NPC and start a natural language conversation directly in-game.
                Using C#, I set up a system where the player's input is sent to OpenAI's language model, and the NPC responds dynamically, creating a more immersive experience. 
                <br> The zombie uses the personality and instructions I've assigned it to deliver cryptic but helpful clues. 
                Once it provides the key clue to progress, it's scripted to recognize the interaction is complete and walk away.
                This seamless blend of narrative, interactivity, and AI-driven behavior adds depth and personality to the experience.

                <b>Blender & Mixamo</b>
                <br>
                I modeled, painted, rigged, and animated custom collectable objects entirely in Blender. 
                I created idle and moving animations to enhance interactivity in the game, implementing individual animation controllers for each.
                <br>For the zombie NPC, I started with a free 3D asset, which I cleaned up, adjusted proportions, and then rigged manually in Blender. 
                I then imported it into Mixamo to apply realistic walking and idle animations. 
                The rigged and animated zombie was brought into Unity, where I used C# scripting to trigger its behavior and movement based on the player's conversation with the NPC.

                <b>Future Work</b>
                <br>
                Now that player mechanics and interactivity have been implemented, I want to focus on the use of agentic AI to build a more realstic non-playable character. 
                Additionally, I'm currently implementing Unity's AI Naviagtion package to allow the NPC to navigate wherever it wants without bumping into objects in the scene.
                <br> I think adding more sound design would also benefit the player experience, as the audio cues are pretty limited as of now. 
                <br>
