                        <b>Summary </b>
                        <br>
                        • Partnered with architecture firm Cooper Carry to investigate new markets for residential stair lifts in a team of 5 students. <br>
                        • Conducted user ethnography through interviews and site visits; produced documentary-style insight video in Premiere Pro. <br>
                        • Designed a modern stair lift concept and wireframed a companion mobile app, delivering findings to firm's stakeholders<br>

                        <b>Identifying Users </b>
                        <br>
                        This project was a collaboration with architecture firm Cooper Carry to reimagine stair lift solutions for urban apartments and dormitories. 
                        Our team conducted in-depth needfinding and research to identify gaps in accessibility, focusing on users with disabilities, residents in elevatorless buildings, and those managing frequent deliveries. 
                        Rather than designing for traditional residential stair lifts, we aimed to develop a compact, fire-safe, and versatile system tailored to tight spaces and modern living constraints.

                        <b>Research Process </b>
                        <br>
                        We began by employing ethnographic observation, personal interviews, and AEIOU analysis to map user needs. 
                        This included interviewing accessibility professionals to understand safety constraints, and surveying residents to gather quantitative feedback where 61% of respondents indicated a device to transport groceries and packages would be useful. 
                        We documented our findings in an insight video, highlighting key stressors such as physical strain, time pressure, and a lack of secure transport options in buildings without elevators.

                    <b>3D & Visualization Work</b>
                    <br>
                    These insights led to the creation of 3D concept models and renderings to visualize potential solutions. 
                    Using Blender and CAD tools, we designed a spatial layout used to communicate ideas to stakeholders, ensuring both functional and aesthetic considerations were addressed. 
                    This visual storytelling was critical in bridging the gap between abstract research insights and tangible product concepts.

                    <b>Insights and Design Imperatives</b>
                    <br>
                    Our research revealed that younger residents, including students and early-career professionals, value independence, security, and adaptability. 
                    Existing solutions often fail to meet these expectations due to space limitations, safety regulations, and infrastructure constraints.
                     We framed our design imperatives as “How Might We” questions, focusing on relieving stress, simplifying transport, and empowering users with disabilities. 
                     The final design direction emphasized ease of use, compactness, fire safety, and compatibility with older building layouts.
