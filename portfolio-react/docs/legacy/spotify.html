                    <b>Role: Technical Lead, UI/UX Designer</b> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a six student team, I was part of creating a personalized Spotify Wrapped experience by integrating the Spotify Web API into a custom Android app. 
                    This app pulls live data from a user's Spotify account, including top artists, songs, and genres, generating a visually engaging, real-time "Spotify Wrapped" summary for any time of the year, not just December.
                    <br> I sketched, prototyped, and implemented the user interface to reflect the musical, dynamic aesthetic of Spotify. 
                    My role also focused on account creation and user profile storage, so that users can securely connect their real Spotify accounts with our app's login system.
                    This project gave me advanced knowledge in API integration, wireframing, user authentication, and mobile development in Android Studio.

                    <b>Firebase & Account Authentication</b>
                    <br>
                    To create a personalized and replyable app for each person, we integrated Firebase into our code to manage user accounts and store data across sessions. 
                    Firebase offered us a real-time backend without needing to write our own server code. 
                    <br> 
                    We used Firebase Authentication to create and manage user accounts. 
                    Each user can sign up and log in using an username and password, and subsequently connect their real-life Spotify account along with it.
                    They can also change their username/password within the app, which will update for the next time they try to login to their account.

                    <b>Sketches & Figma Prototyping</b>
                    <br>
                    I designed an interactive mobile app prototype in Figma that allows users to swipe through different screens, mimicking a native app experience. 
                    Using Figma's interactive components and smart animate transitions, I created a fluid, gesture-based navigation system, just like a real mobile app.
                    Each screen is linked using frame connections and drag triggers, which enable users to swipe left or right to move through the app. 
                    <br> To your left, you'll see the final version of the wireframed UI I made in Figma followed by the final outcome I implemented into Android Studio. 
                    I created XML files for each activity and fragments to create a reusable layout similar to the Figma prototype.
                  </p>

                    <b>Android Studio & Java</b>
                    <br>
                    I created XML files for the activity files and fragments to create a reusable layout similar to the Figma prototype. 
                    Due to my extensive knowledge in Java, I used this as my main programming language to help write logic for buttons, data handling, and navigation. 
                    My main focus on the backend was to first parse the JSON objects received from Spotify's API and reflect that through the user interface. 
                    Here, I was able to aesthetically display the statistic of the user's listening history.
