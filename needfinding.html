                        <b>Unity Game Engine & Rhubarb </b>
                        <br>
                        I worked extensively in Unity using C# to integrate multiple systems-including video, sound, and mechatronics into a cohesive multimedia experience. 
                        My role began as implenting lip synchronization of our 3D characters, creating seamless animation clips in a efficient way. 
                        Using <a href="https://github.com/crdrury/Unity-Rhubarb-Lip-Syncer?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank"> Rhubarb</a>, an Audio2Face-like command-line tool, I helped created custom interpolated animation clips that match prerecorded dialogue, bringing our virtual characters to life. 
                        Also utilizing this tool, we were able to create a sequence of blend shapes to send to our mechatronic animals through an Arduino-readable format, now bringing our physical characters to life as well.                   
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Python & Multithreading Server </b>
                        <br>
                        To control the animatronic characters in real time, we used a Python multithreaded server to communicate motor angle data to an Arduino that drives the physical movements. 
                        By mapping mouth shapes (visemes) to motor angle presets, we achieved real-time lip syncing. 
                        The server continuously streams these angle values to the Arduino, which then moves the servo motors embedded in the animatronic's mouth or limbs accordingly.

                    Thanks to our sponsorship, I was able to present our project midway through to BMW representatives along with a few other selected students, receiving positive feedback and suggestions for future enhancements.
                    We were able to speak with those in the VR/AR department and discuss how virtual environments in Unity used in the real-world.

                    <br>
                    Using the CAD model of our snake robot, I was able to create a digital twin of our mechatronic set up to simulate our desired movements in Blender.
                    I used the motors from inner mechanics to create an armature and added necessary contraints to provide realism. 
                    <br>I created animations accompanying each piece of recorded dialogue to match the robot's body movements to their audio. 
                    Exporting these into Unity, we were able to create multilple TXT files contained motor angles readable for the physical snake's motors.
                    <br>Additionally, I sculpted a snake head in Blender to be 3D printed, providing our robotic snake a skeleton to accompany its mechanics.
