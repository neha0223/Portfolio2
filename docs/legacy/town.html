              <h1>sunken secrets 🌊 speculative VR game<br> using Unity XR Toolkit, C#, & Blender</h1>
              <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Sunken Town is a speculative VR narrative that immerses players in a coastal community now submerged due to rising sea levels. 
                Players explore an underwater town to uncover a family's history, revealing how climate change and inequitable access to resources shaped their fate. 
                Built in Unity with 3D assets edited in Blender, the experience blends environmental storytelling with emotional, intergenerational themes.

                In Sunken Town, players explore the ruins of an underwater town, piecing together the story of a family affected by rising sea levels. 
                To capture the haunting beauty of a world lost to time, I took online assets into Blender and customized them — chipping windows, adding algae growth, bending structures — to give every building and prop a history. 
                This attention to environmental detail turns each location into a storytelling artifact, reinforcing the emotional impact of the narrative.

                <b>Unity Shader and Terrain</b>
                <br>
                In this walkthrough, you'll see how the underwater shader, plant life, and sandy terrain work together to bring Sunken Town to life. 
                The custom underwater shader adds depth-based color fade and light scattering, creating the illusion of being submerged. 
                Layered seaweed and aquatic plants add aging to the scene. 
                <br><br>Additionally, a hand-sculpted sandy terrain in Blender provides a natural, uneven base that ties the entire environment together into a believable underwater world.

                <b>VR and Immersion</b>
                <br>
                Sunken Town uses immersive VR and environmental storytelling to make climate change personal. 
                Built in Unity, the experience relies on assets reworked in Blender to appear aged, waterlogged, and deteriorated — visually communicating the toll of decades underwater. 
                These subtle yet intentional modifications transform generic models into narrative devices, deepening the emotional connection between the player and the world they explore.
